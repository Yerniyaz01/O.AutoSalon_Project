                    Mitsubishi Pajero is a mid-size Japanese SUV,
                    flagship of the Mitsubishi lineup.
                    It was first introduced in 1976 at the Tokyo Motor Show as
                    beach car concept car based on Mitsubishi Jeep,
                    produced under license. Between 1985 and 2007 on sports prototypes
                    Mitsubishi Pajero managed to win 12 victories in the Dakar rally raid.
                    The Pajero model (pəˈhɛroʊ, pɑˈxɛroʊ, pahero) (English) was named
                    so in honor of the Pampas cat (Leopardus pajeros), living on the Patagonia plateau,
                    in southern Argentina. (English) However, since the word pajero has
                    in Spanish slang meaning "wanker", in some foreign markets
                    a different name was adopted. So, in Spain, India and America (except Brazil)
                    it was replaced by Mitsubishi Montero (meaning "highlander warrior"), and in the UK
                    on Mitsubishi Shogun (“shogun”). In Japan, the word Pajero is pronounced “padzero” (Japanese: パジェロ).
                    The pronunciation “Pajero” has also become fixed in the Russian language, from which many
                    various slang nicknames.

                    Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes called G-Wagen (G - short for German Geländewagen - [ɡəˈlɛːndəvaːɡn],
                    "SUV"), colloquial. “Gelik” is a series of full-size luxury SUVs (off-road vehicles),
                    produced in Austria by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) and
                    sold under the Mercedes-Benz brand. Produced from 1979 to the present.
                    The G-Class was developed as a military vehicle at the suggestion of the Shah of Iran
                    Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, at that time a shareholder of Mercedes-Benz.
                    The civilian version of the car was introduced in 1979.
                    Unlike other series of Mercedes-Benz vehicles,
                    G-Class cars retain their unique appearance regardless of
                    modifications, whether factory or high-performance from the division
                    Mercedes-AMG, for several decades now. The G3a model was produced from 1929 to 1935.
